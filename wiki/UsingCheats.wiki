Cheats are stored in a Qoob based file format, they may be edited/updated using the included cheats editor. You may convert action replay codes using GCNCrypt and then add those too.

Swiss comes with a embedded cheats database but if you have an updated one, place it as device:\cheats.qch and it will picked up and loaded instead of the internal cheats database.
