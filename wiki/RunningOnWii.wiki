#summary Instructions on how to get Swiss booting on Wii
#labels Featured

= General Notes =

Swiss hasn't really been designed nor developed to support the Wii. The only real reason it works on there is just by chance cause most Wiis support Gamecube (with the exception of the new "horizontally" orientated Wiis). I have added some specific bits of code to Swiss for the Wii in areas such as when booting multi-game and then some game specific patches (Zelda WW).

= Details =

These are the per-requisites to get Swiss booting on a Wii as it is going to require the Wii to boot it in "Gamecube mode":
  * cMIOS (*I don't endorse this*)
  * WiiPower's Wii Swiss booter
  * Homebrew Channel

Help and how to do all of the above can be found on the [http://www.gc-forever.com forums]
